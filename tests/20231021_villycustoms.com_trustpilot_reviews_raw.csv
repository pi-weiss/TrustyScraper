1,Fun marketing project - Cruiser Bikes from Villy!,"We decided to get new cruiser bikes to sit in front of all of our real estate offices in Vail, Beaver Creek and surrounding towns - great exposure for SSF Real Estate plus fun marketing :)  We also gave some away in contests and broker events.  Everyone loved them!Customer service was good, timing on bikes was a bit delayed but overall good product.  A bit time consuming to put together over 40 bikes but we enjoyed the final product!",2013-08-30,4,nd
2,Horrible experience,"Horrible experience, I received my bike a month ago, pieces missing, paint peeling off, wrong size seat stem.  I called 3 x and a email.  Finally talked to Chris, he assured me all parts will ship 9-28, never happened, called again, talked to Chris waiting for guys in shipping to give him info.  3 calls later and no receipt of promised tracking email, today is 10-7-20 still no parts as promised. This company needs to get their act together I was going to buy my wife and kids a custom bike from Villy, NO WAY.!!",2020-10-08,1,nd
3,Eye-catching product and worth every penny,"If you're thinking of spoiling yourself, then click on over to Villy Customs. You can design your own bike, every color, every detail, and Villy is open to adding just about anything you can think of to trick out your cruiser. The online ordering and preview is easy to use, the customer servise is as nice as could be, all in all, a quality product, a quality company, and you'll have a bike you'll look forward to riding.",2013-08-23,5,nd
4,great once I established successful contact with Villy Custom,"I like - perhaps adore is a better word - my bike!!  People stop when I am riding & tell me they like my bike & that it makes them happy.  It is a very smooth, easy ride.  There is not another one like it!  Initially I had difficulty with successful contact with Villy - slow responses to my emails/calls & the company appeared disorganized. However, once I made successful contact things went great - they even put very cute valve covers & bolt covers on my bide at no extra cost.  There were no problems with shipping either.",2013-08-26,4,nd
5,0 If I Could,"We ordered this bike expecting quality and professionalism. The bike arrived late after we made it abundantly clear that we needed it on a specific date. It also arrived scratched  I spoke to their marketing manager and he said ""we have the highest standards I'll get  a replacement out to you right away"" To this day I have not received the replacement fender.  Also the custom branding is just a cheap sticker. I'm surprised that they would even ask for a review.",2015-09-29,1,nd
6,Assembly takes time and effort,"For the price, this bicycle should have come already assembled. The packing was extensive and meticulous, which tells me that, for a bit more packing, I could have taken it out of the box and ridden away. As it was, by the time I had finished assembly, the front tire was low, and I still haven't ridden it. It's a beautiful bike--just as I imagined it--but next time, I would go to a local bike store and ride one home.",2015-09-30,3,nd
7,Villy Customs bikes are fun and have a personality that I love!,"Definitely recommend Villy Customs.  When I bought my bike, I originally had no intentions of getting one. I got to design exactly what I wanted for a very reasonable price, and couldn't be happier with the result.   I also ride a road bike, but sometimes prefer the cruiser because its so unique and fun. My husband has one now too - we love it!",2013-09-05,5,nd
8,Had damage in shipment,"Box arrived with damage.  Called Villy and they got to the (FedEx)  The box was picked up the next day and returned to Villy.  Villy immediately replaced the damaged parts and shipped the bike back.  The entire turnaround took less than 7 days. They are excellent to deal with on the phone and followed-up with calls to keep us informed.  I highly recommend Villy Custom Bike. My wife loves new bike and gets lots of comments when she is out riding the green-way through the parks.",2015-09-29,5,nd
9,The best present I ever received.,"My Villy's Custom Bike is the envy of our neighborhood!  We added a front carrying baby seat so my son can ride with me and we get compliments everywhere we go.  The bike is gorgeous, customized to my character and of the highest quality.  I love my bike and we will be buying more in the near future for my husband and son.",2013-08-31,5,nd
10,Make each day a VILLY DAY!,"I was immediately captivated by this company, this product and founder, the very first time I saw him on Shark Tank. The second viewing of Shark Tank and the bicycle caused me to immediately open the website and 'build & buy' my very own VILLY DAY bike!",2013-08-23,5,nd
11,Love the bikes,"Love the ability to customize bikes, I just wish  that they still carried the bike baskets and other design of cup holder, had wider choice of accessories, and I miss the old bike customization program. The new one is not as good.",2013-08-25,5,nd
12,Awesome Bikes!,"We bought 2 bikes after seeing Fleetwood show them on Shark Tank.  While ST peeked our interest, once we got to Villy's website and started working with their team, that's when we were hooked. Overall, the design process (through the website) was a breeze.  They arrived looking great.  The install process was easy as pie.  We used the guide and the online video to quickly put our bikes together. We even had some follow-up dialog with the folks at Villy.  Nothing big and mostly virtual, but every interaction was great.  Fleetwood even picked up the phone; it's always cool when the owner is engaged. Of paramount import, we love our Villy Customs.  They look great and ride smooth.  We ride them around our neighborhood all the time.  They still get looks. As we've already done on several occasions, we highly recommend Villy Customs.",2013-08-26,5,nd
13,I love my bike!!!!!,The ordering experience was so easy and the customer service is second to none! I love my bike and just might order another one in another color!! Oh and soooo happy I got the basket!!! Thank you so much for getting me back riding again!!!,2015-09-30,5,nd
14,Amazing customizable fashion bikes,"Villy Customs is a really cool company. Being able to go online and fully customize a beach cruiser style bike and actually see the colors and style as you do it is waaay cool. The quality of the bikes is really, really good, and there are lots of options, which is fun.  Loving Villy!",2013-08-27,5,nd
15,I love my bike!!,"The entire process was so much fun. I spent hours designing and re-designing my bike! Once I placed my order, I waited with great anticipation for it to arrive. Putting it together was simple--everything was well marked, the instructions were in ENGLISH and very easy to follow, all the holes matched up and there were the right number of screws in the package! Within two hours I was cruising on my new bike. I show horses and the venues are large and sometimes our RV is parked far from the show arena--this bike is going to the horse shows so I can commute from the RV to the horse barn in style. I will be the envy of all my friends--especially with my red dice valve covers! I love my bike and I love that it's made in the USA right in my home state of Texas!",2013-08-26,5,nd
16,I love Villy Custom.,"I purchased my bike in Nov 2012.  I love my bike, perfect for cruising.  I enjoyed building it online and seeing the finished product before purchase.  I plan to order some accessories next week.  I wish I could order a smaller version for my soon to be 5 yr old so we could match.  Keep up the good work.",2013-08-24,5,nd
17,"the most beautiful, stylish bikes ever","I loved the experience of getting to pick out exactly how my bike was going to look.  And when it arrived-- it was just as cute as it looked when I designed it online.  Actually, even better!  Such a fun buying experience, and I LOVE my bike!",2013-08-28,5,nd
18,I purchased a custom bike for my wife…,"I purchased a custom bike for my wife as a Christmas gift and she could not wait to ride it. It brings a smile to our faces when we look at it so colorful it just makes you smile. We live in Chicagoland so we had to wait for a good weather day. The day came and as I watched my wife take off down the street all I could think was how no one else has the same one, she loves it. Quality built, great customer service and a joy to ride. I recommend Villy to anyone and they will not rest until you are completely satisfied especially Chris will make sure of it. I give them ten stars!",2020-02-13,5,nd
19,Happy customer,Excellent product and excellent customer service. Very very happy with the whole purchase process and the people there are great. Will buy from them again. Oh and the bike is better and nicer than I even expected. Worth every penny. Thanks villy,2015-09-29,5,nd
20,Most Awesome Bike Ever!,"I can't believe I finally have my custom cruiser bike.  I saw you on television and said ""I have to get one of those"".  And I saw a bunch of Villy Cruisers on the bike trail near my house - but for whatever reason, I always put off visiting the website to order my bike.   Well, I finally did it!  First of all, your website is awesome - I created my one-of-a-kind cruiser in minutes.  Second, my bike was here in no time!  Thanks so much, Villy Customs.  You have no idea how proud I am of this ""smooth ride"".",2013-08-30,5,nd
21,MAKE IT LIKE YOU WANT IT,"GREAT COMPANY - NEED FOR EXPERTS IN GRAPHIC DESIGN THAT CAN COMMUNICATE PROPERLY WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR SUBMITTED LOGOS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I WAS TRULY INPRESSED WITH MY BIKE! AND PROBABLY WILL HAVE ANOTHER BIKE MADE IN THE FUTURE THAT REPRESENTS MY HIGH SCHOOL LOGO AND COLORS",2013-08-28,4,nd
22,Rolling Around town,"Absolutely beautiful work, they are truly artists. The bike has worked wonderfully for the past two years and I've used it everyday! I would recommend to anyone.",2013-08-28,5,nd
23,Love the color that I picked but…,Love the color that I picked but overall the bike is low quality. Value is just not there will not recommend or buy another bike from Villy.,2021-11-17,2,nd
24,Crusing around campus,I love my Villy bike! I got it for college and I absolutely love it. In the bike rack my bike definitely stands out from the rest. I have gotten so many compliments on my custom made Villy bike. So many of my friends are also thinking about buying one because they love mine so much!,2013-08-30,5,nd
25,Awesome people to work - average product,"I ordered 2 bikes. The limited edition pearl bike for myself and a custom bike for my fiancé. I worked with Airion - he is amazing! He sent me a couple custom mock ups of the custom bike before deciding to go with one. I also wanted a gold basket to match my bike and he was able to get that done for me. Unfortunately the back fender of mine came bent right out of the box (due to shipping) so they generously sent me a new one. I guess something happened with the powder coat on my fiancé bike and they needed to re paint the whole thing which delayed his bike by a few weeks - complete bummer. Airion needed up sending us some swag which was nice and we finally ended getting the bike about 2 and half months later! (He did tell me that the custom bike would take about 2 weeks longer than the normal 2-3 weeks but it was WAY longer than expected). So the process was kind of a pain but Airion made it tolerable! :) The bikes themselves are subpar. The bikes together cost around $1,800 but the quality just isn't there for that amount of money. You are paying for a cool looking bike - which I do love but there just not really solid.",2015-09-30,4,nd
26,"Nice custormer service, cute bike, but too big for me.","I spent a lot of money on a bike that does not fit me.  This greatly decreases the fun I have on the bike.  I am pretty tall, so I wonder if other people have the same problem. I don't think buying a bike that you cannot personally try out is a good idea.",2013-08-27,4,nd
27,loving my villy customs cruiser bike!,"I can't explain how much I am loving my villy custom bicycle, since I got it I've been riding my bike everyday. I love the way it is fun and at the same time it is a good workout for me. Keep up the good work guys!!",2013-08-25,5,nd
28,Poor customer aervice,"I ordered a bike for my wife's birthday, took close to 3 months to be delivered. I had to constantly email to get any information provided as to when I could expect it. Even if I new there",2015-09-29,2,nd
29,The coolest bikes on the planet!,I love color... I love bikes... I loved that I could customize every part of my bike and pick out all the details.  When I received my bike it was exactly what I had envisioned! Thanks Villy Customs for such a great service!!!!!,2013-08-27,5,nd
30,Wife loves her Villy,I was running late on getting my wife a mothers day gift. The Wife mentioned she wanted a beach cruiser and I looked them up on the web. Villy came up in the search and they were here in Dallas where i lived. The bikes were more than I wanted to spend but they got the bike built and ready to pick up with in 4 or 5 days just in time for mothers day. great service and the quality of the bike is top notch. you really get what you pay for here.,2015-09-29,5,nd
31,Great Company .... Great Service ..... Great People,"I bought 1 Villy as a gift for my significant otherWhen it came I said "" Damn they look better in person "" So I purchased 1 for myself.   Love them great idea but mostly a Great BikeOh I also won a Villy BikeCan't have too many!!!!!",2013-08-23,5,nd
32,Custom price without the custom…,"Custom price without the custom quality.  I'm very upset and disappointed with this ""custom"" bike.  There are many flaws in the paint on many pieces of this bike.  I believe it's because Villy doesn't have the resources to keep up with their demand.  This leads to a flawed product for a very high price.  All of this exposed metal is going to also lead to rust which means this bike isn't going to last long.Powder coat has chipping issues when its under cured (meaning rush job). ""The main reason for powder to peel or flake off the substrate is due to lack of adhesion between the powder and the substrate. ... Under curing is also another issue with peeling powder coat. Powder which is under cured lacks many of the mechanical properties of a cured powder.""This is the case all over this bike for me and when brought to Villy's attension they said to use nail polish to cover the chips.  Wouldn't be a big issue with what I saw initially but when looking more all over the bike, there are paint flaws everywhere. I'm sure more will pop up too as the bike is used.  It hasn't even been used yet. Just now, I noticed the chain was very loose so I loosened the bolts on the back wheel to tighten the chain tension.  When I retightened the bolts on the wheel the paint just chipped right off the frame and I didn't even tighten it all the way.  While I have the bike up I noticed more paint issues on the forks near the front wheel and near the bolts on the front fork.This is just a sorry excuse for custom bike that's riding the coat tails of Shark Tank.  Super disappointed.",2021-01-04,1,nd
33,Villiy Customs is CUSTOM,"Good service, fantastic web site. I was completely satisfied and plesantly suprised at the creation of my cruiser.",2013-11-03,5,nd
